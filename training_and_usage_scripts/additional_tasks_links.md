#### Fine-grained classification
1. WSDAN method (Simply replace the backbone in 'models' directory with our TD model and load model in train.py)
    - Pytorch: https://github.com/GuYuc/WS-DAN.PyTorch
    - Tensorflow: https://github.com/tau-yihouxiang/WS_DAN (official)
    
#### Multi-label image classification
2. ASL loss method (Simply replace the backbone in 'src/models/' with our TD model and load model in train.py)
    - Pytorch: https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ASL
